To Run the webservice first go to a terminal window and 
browse to this directory ../webservice and run the code below

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install
```
Then While still in the webservice directory run
```bash
$ npm start
```
The app should start at localhost:4005

To run the webapp open another terminal window and go to the 
../webapp direcotry and run
```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install
```

Then While still in the webapp directory run
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

This should start the client running at localhost:3000

This was a really fun challenge even thoug I didn't get it all up and running because of the time constraint I felt that
I learned much. 

To Imporve the poroject I need to actually get the front end to display the movie data
I need to add more error checking.
I need to add more tests.
I need to refactor strings into env files or propery files.

I really appreciate your time.
Thank you.

Any feedback would be welcome joecoolatbyu@hotmail.com
